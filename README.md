This ISS Tracker web app provides real-time tracking of the International Space Station with a live map and 3D globe visualization. It displays updated coordinates (latitude, longitude), altitude, speed, and distance from a fixed point (Mumbai). The app plots dynamic charts of altitude and speed over time and draws the ISS trail on both 2D and 3D views. It also checks for sunlight status using TLE data, predicts upcoming visible passes over your location, and allows users to download the ISS path as a CSV. Built with Python, Streamlit, Folium, Altair, Pydeck, and powered by the N2YO API, this tool delivers an engaging space-tracking experience in the browser.
